# Deploying on dokku

[Dokku](https://github.com/progrium/dokku) is a Docker powered mini-Heroku in around 100 lines of Bash.

If you’re familiar with using git in the command line, you’ll have no trouble deploying your Harp app to Dokku.

## Setup a dokku environment

You can install Dokku on your own by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/progrium/dokku#requirements) or another approach is using a DigitalOcean [dropplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-dokku-application).

## Overriding nginx configurations

With this dokku buildpack you should be able to override some nginx settings. I've not tried this yet, but, for information on how to override the settings checkout the [nginx buildpack repo](https://github.com/rhy-jot/buildpack-nginx)

## Setuping a development environment

**Requirements:** git, node 0.10.x, npm 1.2.x

### 1. Setting up the remote repo

Clone this repo to your location machine `git clone https://github.com/subhaze/hb-dokku-nginx.git <your_app_name>` then `cd <your_app_name>` into the folder you cloned to and setup the remote repo, which should be something like: `git remote add dokku dokku@<your_domain>:<your_app_name>`

### 2. Running locally

If you have harp installed globally `npm install -g harp` you can start up the harp server via `harp server`. If you don't have harp setup you can run `npm install` to install it locally and then you can start up the app via `node_modules/.bin/harp server`

### 3. Deploying your app

First compile your app via `harp compile`

Now all you have to do is commit the new compile you've create then `git push dokku master` and you've just deployed your [harp](http://harpjs.com/) app!
